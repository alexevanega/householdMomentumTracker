- <Phase N short label / scope summary>

### Audit Result
Audit Summary (Phase <N> run)
I audited the repo strictly against <PATH_TO_PHASE_DOC> Phase <N> scope, and all required checks <pass/fail>. Final verdict: <PASS/FAIL>.

PASS/FAIL Results
<Check Name 1> — <PASS/FAIL>
<1–2 sentence justification tied to phase requirements.>

<Check Name 2> — <PASS/FAIL>
<1–2 sentence justification tied to phase requirements.>

<Check Name 3> — <PASS/FAIL>
<1–2 sentence justification tied to phase requirements.>

<Add as many checks as needed; keep each check scoped and atomic.>

Findings
<If PASS: "No Phase <N>-scope failures found.">
<If FAIL: Bullet list of failures. For each failure include: file path(s), line reference(s) if applicable, and what requirement it violates.>

Final Verdict
<PASS/FAIL>

Testing / checks run
✅ <command 1>
✅ <command 2>
✅ <command 3>
<Include all commands executed, in the order they were run.>
<If a command is “logical inspection only”, still list it (e.g., sed/nl).>

No repository changes were made in this rerun audit, so no commit/PR was created.
